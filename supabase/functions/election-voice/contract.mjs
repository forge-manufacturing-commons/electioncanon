// ELECTIONCANON VOICE — WIRE CONTRACT  (Alpha 1.2)
//
// The request/response shapes at the voice boundary, modelled directly on
// supabase/functions/forge-ai/contract.mjs — plain JavaScript, no Deno
// APIs, so Deno runs it in production and Node runs the exact same code
// in the test suite. See that file's own header for why the validator
// being under test (not just the transport) is the actual security
// control.
//
// PROVIDER-AGNOSTIC BY CONSTRUCTION. `PROVIDER_PROFILES` held ZERO
// entries through Alpha 1.2 — the user explicitly deferred picking a
// vendor until pricing/language coverage could be compared. Alpha 1.3
// did that comparison for real (Google Cloud, Azure, and three
// Nigeria-specific specialists — see docs/electioncanon/VOICE.md §
// "Provider comparison" for the sourced table) and registers exactly
// ONE real profile below: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text (Chirp/Chirp 2),
// the only candidate with BOTH documented Hausa/Yoruba/Igbo coverage AND
// a public wire-format reference precise enough to implement against
// without guessing. It STILL resolves to PROVIDER_NOT_CONFIGURED in
// every real deployment of this repository, because no
// ELECTION_VOICE_PROVIDER_KEY has ever been set here — registering the
// profile is not the same claim as having tested it live, and index.ts
// never pretends otherwise.

   * A REAL, DOCUMENTED LIMITATION, STATED RATHER THAN HIDDEN: Google's
   * bearer token here is a short-lived OAuth2 access token minted from a
   * service-account credential — NOT a static long-lived key like
   * forge-ai's OpenAI profile. This repository does not implement the
   * service-account JWT-bearer exchange (custom RS256 JWT signing code
   * that could never be tested live here, without a real Google project,
   * is a correctness risk this codebase's own discipline weighs against
   * shipping unverified). `ELECTION_VOICE_PROVIDER_KEY` for this profile
   * is therefore expected to already BE a valid access token, refreshed
   * by the deployer's own operational tooling (e.g. a scheduled job
   * running `gcloud auth print-access-token` for the service account, or
   * a small token-minting sidecar) — see docs/electioncanon/VOICE.md for
   * the full reasoning and the upgrade path to a real JWT exchange.
   *
   * Pidgin and Urhobo are absent from `sttSupportedLangs` on purpose —
   * Google's own supported-languages table lists no `pcm`/`urh` locale,
   * confirmed by reading that table directly, not assumed from the other
   * three being present.
