// This repository has NO React-rendering test harness (no Jest/Vitest/
// jsdom/@testing-library — CLAUDE.md states plainly: "Tests are plain Node
// scripts, not a framework"). These are therefore STRUCTURAL/ARCHITECTURAL
// tests — the strongest evidence this repo's existing infrastructure
// supports — proving the source-level contract src/pages/Election.jsx must
// hold, exactly the same style test/election.consumer.mjs's own D4/H1-style
// checks already use for the same reason.
//
// The RUNTIME behavior (the page actually renders "Not signed in" with no
// console errors, and /, /workspace are unaffected) was verified separately
// this loop via a live Vite dev server + browser automation — that
// verification is not repeated here as an automated test because this
// repository has no headless-browser test runner; it is disclosed as its
// own MOCK/manual evidence class in the final report, never upgraded to
// "automated" or "LIVE".
