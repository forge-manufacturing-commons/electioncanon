// ============================================================
// FORGE ELECTION — CANONICAL EVENT SCHEMA  (MVP domain pack)
//
// A SIBLING to src/os/events.js, not an extension of it. The manufacturing
// EVENT_TYPES vocabulary is frozen at 34 types and asserted so by 7 test files —
// this module never imports or merges into it. It reuses only the GENERIC event
// mechanics (createEvent, makeEventId, EVENT_SCHEMA_VERSION, and the
// MISSION_POLICY_LEVEL enum, which is domain-neutral vocabulary about a concept —
// "may this event belong to a mission?" — not about manufacturing specifically).
//
// SELF-CONTAINED, LIKE ITS SIBLING. It does not import a registry or a studio
// topology, for the same reason: producers should not be broken by modules that
// do not exist yet, and this should not need rewriting when they arrive.
//
// MVP SCOPE. Just enough event types to make the demo candidate's Canon real:
// registering a candidate, assigning a ward to a responsible party, and
// reporting a ward's status. Not exhaustive — see docs/BUSINESS-AI-DOMAIN-CONTRACT.md
// for the sibling contract this pack's shape is meant to be copied for.
//
// CAPABILITY IS DECLARED, NOT YET WIRED. `EVENT_CAPABILITY` below is shaped
// exactly like src/os/events.js's own map (event type -> capability string) so
// it can be merged into policy.js's live check later — but this MVP phase does
// not touch events.js/Roles.js/policy.js, so nothing here is currently enforced
// by requireCapability. No live write path is exercised by the demo or the
// tests; this is the explicit, honest gap TRANSITIONAL.md-style documentation
// exists to name rather than to quietly assume closed.
//
// LOOP (TENANT SCOPING) adds `campaign` — REQUIRED on every event type,
// mirroring Business's `organisation` field on `projectBusiness(log,
// organisationId)`. Before this, `projectElection` folded whatever log it
// was handed with no internal scope check at all; isolation was pure
// caller discipline (never mixing two candidates' events into one array).
// See projections.js for the fold-side half of this.
//
// LOOP 29 adds `observer.assignment.recorded` — the FIRST non-candidate
// preparedness fact. Reconnaissance (this loop) found no authoritative
// source for anything richer (accreditation, training, deployment
// coverage, a polling-unit master geography) — see
// src/domains/election/studio/observerReadiness.js's own header for the
// full list of what stays explicitly unsupported. This event establishes
// exactly ONE fact: an identified observer has a recorded assignment to an
// operational location. `location` is free text, the SAME honesty
// `ward`/`constituency` already carry (no geographic hierarchy exists to
// validate against) — never called `polling_unit`, because no polling-unit
// master geography exists in this repository to make that name true.

 *  (Alpha 1.1) is the private Storage object path of the uploaded
 *  result-sheet photo — uploaded by the caller BEFORE this event is
 *  written (see electionDay/evidence.js); this event only ever records the
 *  resulting path, never the image bytes. `extractedFields` is an array of
 *  `{ field, value, ocrValue, confidence, source }` — `source` is one of
 *  "manual" (nothing OCR-derived), "ocr_confirmed" (a human accepted the
 *  OCR value as-is), or "ocr_corrected" (a human typed a different value
 *  than OCR read); `ocrValue` is only ever present alongside the latter two
 *  and is never overwritten — a correction changes `value`, never erases
 *  what OCR actually said. `confidence` on a human-facing field entry
 *  stays whatever the OCR pass reported (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) or `null` for a
 *  purely manual entry — this factory itself does not compute it.
 *  `evidenceHash` (Alpha 1.3) is a SHA-256 of the uploaded photo's raw
 *  bytes (see electionDay/evidence.js's `hashResultEvidence`) — recorded

 *  RAW machine reading, kept separate from the human-facing
 *  `extractedFields` on `RESULT_CAPTURED`/this event's own consumers so
 *  "what OCR said" and "what a human confirmed" are never collapsed into
 *  one mutable value. `ocrProvider` names the extraction engine (e.g.
 *  "tesseract.js") for audit purposes only — never surfaced as a claim of
 *  accuracy. `ocrStatus` is required and is one of NOT_RUN/PROCESSING/
 *  COMPLETE/FAILED/UNAVAILABLE (see electionDay/ocr.js's `OCR_STATUS`). */
