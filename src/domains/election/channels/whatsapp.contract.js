// ============================================================
// ELECTIONCANON — WHATSAPP CHANNEL CONTRACT (STUB, NOT WIRED)
//
// This file is NOT imported anywhere in the app. It exists only to make
// the shape of a future WhatsApp channel adapter concrete in code, next
// to the prose contract in docs/electioncanon/WHATSAPP.md (read that
// file first — this stub follows it function-for-function).
//
// No WhatsApp Business API credentials exist in this codebase. No
// message has ever been sent or received through WhatsApp by
// ElectionCanon. Every function below is an unimplemented shape, not a
// working adapter — each throws if actually called, so an accidental
// import cannot silently pretend to be a real channel.
//
// The point of this file: when real WhatsApp integration work happens,
// it should be "implement these functions against real credentials,"
// not "invent the contract from scratch." Every function here forwards
// to the SAME channel-agnostic domain functions the web UI already
// calls (src/os/electionWebAdapter.js, src/domains/election/*/write.js,
// src/domains/election/electionDay/evidence.js) — a WhatsApp adapter
// must never re-implement election business logic, RLS, or the
// PREPARE -> APPROVE discipline of its own.
