// ============================================================
// FORGE — LANGUAGE CAPABILITY REGISTRY  (Alpha 1.3)
//
// ElectionCanon's six target languages (English, Nigerian Pidgin, Hausa,
// Yoruba, Igbo, Urhobo), each with an EXPLICIT, COMPUTED status — never
// a hardcoded claim, and never a single flattened "supported: true/false"
// boolean.
//
// WHY THIS IS STRUCTURED, NOT ONE ENUM. The brief's five states
// (VERIFIED/REVIEW_REQUIRED/TEXT_AVAILABLE/VOICE_AVAILABLE/UNAVAILABLE)
// describe THREE ORTHOGONAL FACTS: whether text realisation is reviewed,
// whether voice speech-to-text works, whether voice text-to-speech works.
// A language can be TEXT-reviewed and VOICE-unavailable at once (Urhobo),
// or voice-capable-once-configured and TEXT-unreviewed (Hausa). Collapsing
// these into one value would hide exactly the distinction this codebase's
// honesty discipline exists to preserve — the same reason `MISSION_POLICY`
// keeps `UNKNOWN` distinct from `OPTIONAL` rather than merging them.
//
// EVERYTHING BELOW IS COMPUTED FROM REAL STATE, NOT ASSERTED. `textStatus`
// reads each pack's own `lexiconCoverage()`; `detection` reads
// `language.js`'s real detector; `voiceStt`/`voiceTts` read the actual
// registered provider profiles in supabase/functions/election-voice/
// contract.mjs (imported by path reference here as a plain data mirror —
// see NOTE below on why this file can't literally `import` a Deno module).
// ============================================================
